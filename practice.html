      <h1>BMW 3.0 CS</h1>
      <p>With years of automotive history behind us, we’ve reached a point where it’s possible to create a bespoke car. Sure, coachbuilt specials have been around forever and the modifications seen here aren’t too extreme, but the fact is that Joshua Stern had an idea of his perfect classic BMW coupé—and made it a reality.s</p>
      <p>The result is a 1973 BMW 3.0 CS that’s been treated to extensive modifications, inside and out, that are equal parts supercar and subtle. From the ground up, of course: a full bare metal restoration was the first step in a process that eventually led to the fitment of modified BMW CSL suspension with stock-looking coilovers, a 350 horsepower S54 3.2-litre inline-6 cylinder engine and 6-speed transmission from a 2003 M3, and extensive tuning to ensure the car performed as reliably as possible.</p>
